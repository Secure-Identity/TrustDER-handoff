The github repository containing the code for the project exists at [https://github.com/Secure-Identity/HyperledgerFabricNetwork](https://github.com/Secure-Identity/HyperledgerFabricNetwork) and [https://github.com/Secure-Identity/HLFNetwork-V2](https://github.com/Secure-Identity/HLFNetwork-V2). These repositories contain the scripts required to setup the environment, install and run the system, user manual and code walkthrough, besides the actual code. Hence the reason for excluding the user manual in this folder.
